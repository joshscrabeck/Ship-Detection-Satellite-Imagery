# Ship-Detection-Satellite-Imagery

##This Python script ingests data from a Kaggle challenge, then analyzes the satellite imagery data, and locates ships from each image using a VGG16 model, a CNN model, and a ResNet50 model. All of these machine learning models are based on building Convolutional Neural Networks.
